import tweepy
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

API_KEY = os.getenv("TWITTER_API_KEY")
API_SECRET = os.getenv("TWITTER_API_SECRET")
ACCESS_TOKEN = os.getenv("TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN")
TOKEN_SECRET = os.getenv("TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET")

twitter_oauth = tweepy.OAuthHandler(API_KEY, API_SECRET)
twitter_oauth.set_access_token(ACCESS_TOKEN, TOKEN_SECRET)# instantiate tweepy api object using the authentication handler object
twitter_api = tweepy.API(twitter_oauth)# attempt credential verification. prints exception if something is wrong
try:
  print(twitter_api.verify_credentials())
  print("Successfully logged in")
except tweepy.TweepError as e:
  print(e)
except Exception as e:
  print(e)

import tweepy# create new class "StreamListener" 
# takes in tweepy.StreamListener as a parameter
class StreamListener(tweepy.StreamListener):
  def __init__(self, api):
    self.api = api
    self.me = api.me()

Next, we‚Äôre going to definte two functions: on_status and on_error. The on_status function will contain the logic behind what we do with each tweet we receive from the stream listener. The on_error function will contain the logic behind what happens if something goes wrong.

in streamlistener.py# import dependencies
import tweepy# create new class "StreamListener" 
# takes in tweepy.StreamListener as a parameter
class StreamListener(tweepy.StreamListener):
  def __init__(self, api):
    self.api = api
    self.me = api.me()
  
  # the function containing the logic on what to do for each tweet
  def on_status(self, tweet):
    # We only want the bot to retweet original tweets, not replies.
    # We also don't want the bot to retweet itself
    if tweet.in_reply_to_status_id is not None or \
      tweet.use.id == self.me.id:
      return    # If we haven't retweeted this tweet yet, retweet it   
    if not tweet.retweeted:
      try: 
        tweet.retweet()
        print("Tweet retweeted successfully")
      except Exception as e:
        print(e)  # the function containing the logic in case there is an error  
  def on_error(self, status):
    print(f"Error while retweeting: {status}")

In the on_status function, we want to ignore any tweets that are replies to other tweets, and we want the bot to ignore it‚Äôs own retweets. To do this, we just check for those conditions and simply ‚Äúreturn‚Äù if they are true. After this, we check if we have already retweeted that tweet and if not, we use the retweet() method that is available to the tweet object to retweet that tweet.

    As a side note, some bots also favorite the tweet when they retweet it. If you also want this functionality, you just check to see if you have favorited the tweet already in the same way you check for retweets, and then you use the favorite() method available to the tweet object.

  # the function containing the logic on what to do for each tweet
  def on_status(self, tweet):
    # We only want the bot to retweet original tweets, not replies.
    # We also don't want the bot to retweet itself
    if tweet.in_reply_to_status_id is not None or \
      tweet.use.id == self.me.id:
      return    # If we haven't retweeted this tweet yet, retweet it   
    if not tweet.retweeted:
      try: 
        tweet.retweet()
        print("Tweet retweeted successfully")
      except Exception as e:
        print(e)    # If we haven't favorited this tweet yet, favorite it
    if not tweet.favorited:
      try:
        tweet.favorite()
        print("Tweet favorited successfully")
      except Exception as e:
        print(e)

Now that we‚Äôve completed this file, we can now use it in our bot.py file. Import the StreamListener class and instantiate a new StreamListener object. Pass in the Twitter API object as a parameter. After this, we‚Äôre going to instantiate a tweepy.Stream object, passing in our Twitter API‚Äôs auth parameter and the new StreamListener object.

After this, we use the filter() method available to the tweepy.Stream class, passing in ‚Äòtrack=[‚Äú#100DaysOfCode‚Äù, ‚Äú#AnotherHashtagWeMightWannaTrack‚Äù]‚Äô to signal that we want to track these specific hashtags/search results and ‚Äòlanguages=[‚Äúen‚Äù, ‚ÄúMaybeSomeOtherLanguage‚Äù]‚Äô to signal that we only want tweets in English and maybe another specific language. Your bot.py should now look something like:

in bot.py# import dependencies
import tweepy
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from streamlistener import StreamListener <-- Make sure to have this# load our .env file to make use of the environment variables
load_dotenv()# import and assign our environment variables
API_KEY = os.getenv('twitter_api_key')
API_SECRET = os.getenv('twitter_api_secret')
ACCESS_TOKEN = os.getenv('twitter_access_token')
TOKEN_SECRET = os.getenv('twitter_token_secret')# instantiate oauth handler and set access token
twitter_oauth = tweepy.OAuthHandler(API_KEY, API_SECRET)
twitter_oauth.set_access_token(ACCESS_TOKEN, TOKEN_SECRET)# instantiate tweepy api object using the authentication handler object
twitter_api = tweepy.API(twitter_oauth)# attempt credential verification. prints exception if something is wrong
try:
  print(twitter_api.verify_credentials())
  print("Successfully logged in")
except tweepy.TweepError as e:
  print(e)
except Exception as e:
  print(e)# instantiate a StreamListener object
tweets_listener = StreamListener(twitter_api)# instantiate a tweepy.Stream object
tweet_stream = tweepy.Stream(twitter_api.auth, tweets_listener)# Use the filter method
tweet_stream.filter(track=["#100DaysOfCode", "#30DaysOfCode"], languages=["en"])

At this point, you should be able to run ‚Äúpython bot.py‚Äù in your terminal and it will log in and start retweeting and favoriting.
Success!
Conclusion

This is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to what you can do with this bot. You can add additional logic to StreamListener‚Äôs on_status method to do things like filter out other bot users or determine based on someone‚Äôs profile whether or not you want to retweet their tweet (trying to implement a filter that tries to identify descriptions that belong to malicious users).
